# Topcoder Submissions API

## Overview

This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

## Local Deployment

- Create a credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials on Mac/Linux or C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials on Windows (this is only needed if you intend to use the POST `/submissions` api to upload a file to Amazon S3)

```bash
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key
```

- run the server `npm start`
- view the Swagger UI interface at http://localhost:8080/docs
- the server itself is located at http://localhost:8080/v5/

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.

## Configuration

Edit configuration in config/default.json
Following variables can be configured:

- `s3.bucket` the bucket where submission files will be stored. This is only needed if you intend to use the POST `/submissions` api to upload a file to Amazon S3

## Verification

- Only the POST `/submissions` endpoint to upload a file to Amazon S3 can be verified using POSTMAN
- Import docs/postman_collection.json and docs/postman_environment.json into Postman
- Execute the calls in Postman to verify the endpoints
- For other endpoints, check out the Swagger UI interface at http://localhost:8080/docs
